    "* Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.\n",
    "* This can be done by freezing the weights of the first model and then training the second model on a new dataset.\n",
    "* This can help to improve the performance of the second model, as it can start from a point where the first model has already learned some important features."
