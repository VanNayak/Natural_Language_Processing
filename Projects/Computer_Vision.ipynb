    "* Computer Vision is one of the fields of artificial intelligence that trains and enables computers to understand the visual world.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computers can use digital images and deep learning models to accurately identify and classify objecs and react to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computer vision in AI is dedicated to the development of automated systems that can inter pret visual data (such as photographs or motion pictures) in the same manner as people do.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The idea behind computer vision is to interpret and comprehend images on a pixel-ny-pixel basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is the foundation of the computer vision field. Regarding the technical side of things, computers will seem to extract visual data, manage it, and analyze the outcomes using sophisticated software programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The amount of data that we generate today is tremendous i.e., 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This growth in data has proven to be one of the driving factors behind the development of computer vision."
